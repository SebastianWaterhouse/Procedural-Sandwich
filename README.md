# Procedural-Sandwich
=====================
Procedural Sandwich is a procedural text-based sandwich generator made from python.

NOTE
====
This is the `flavors` branch. This is experimental and doesn't have as many toppings, weird mode is disabled, but sandwiches should be more likely to be yummy. The default vegetable is `tomato` and the default cheese is `cheddar`.

Running the Program
===================
Step 1: Download python 3.4 at https://www.python.org/downloads/

Step 2: Either clone the repository if you already have git, or download the ZIP via the handy "Download ZIP" button on the github site.

Step 3: (If you downloaded the ZIP) Extract the ZIP to any folder.

Step 4: Navigate to this folder with a command prompt.

Step 5: Type in `python proceduralsandwich.py`
